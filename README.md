# steam locomotive 

i will often hit `sl` instead of `ls` 

now there's a steam locomotive that goes across my screen

i think there's another package out there that does something similar, but i wanted to make it myself


## to use:

on a unix style system: 

```
make install
```

then:

```
sl
```
